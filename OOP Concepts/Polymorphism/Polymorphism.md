# Polymorphism

The word `Polymorphism` is derived from `Polymorph`.
`Poly` means many and `morph` means trasnforming from one state to another.

In Object Oriented Programming, Polymorphism allows us to define multiple methods with the same name but different functionalities.
Polymorphism is achieved by method [overriding](/OOP%20Concepts/Polymorphism/overriding.md) and method [overloading](/OOP%20Concepts/Polymorphism/overloading.md). In the next section, we are going to learn these concepts.
